              Hired to extend legacy LAMP mobile forensics LIMS (Laboratory Information Management System) for Law Enforcement entities of all levels; customers included U.S. Secret Service, NYPD, LAPD, New South Wales Police Force (Australia), UAE Ministry of the Interior, many more.
              Transformed to MVC architecture with select operations as Services.
              Enforced PSR-2 standard and code quality with phpstan, phpcs/phpcbf, psalm, phpunit, prettier js.
              DB model changes managed with Phinx, easily rolled back / forward by app version.
              Continually improved app infrastructure and deployment tooling with Docker, Kubernetes, Helm, ArgoCD. Hosted in AWS & Azure clouds (Gov and Civilian) or on-prem on customer's infrastructure.

                    Executed several radical data model shifts to drive major application version updates. Extreme variance in process and lab work performed across international LE entities necessitated very high levels of customization in data input and reporting while maintaining compliance to ISO-17025 for lab accreditation

                    Overhauled image delivery for increased efficiency and speed. An S3 listener on the original image bucket resizes uploaded images to all dimension steps below original width and saves them to another bucket which feeds
                    redundant CDN caching (Akamai and Fastly). Reduced CPU utilization and EC2 instance sizes from previous system of dynamic resizing and mostly eliminated load times by having all sizes at the edge. Animated gifs are converted to both
                    webm and mp4 and cached similarly.

                    Created Go service to fix HREFLang tags which were hurting SEO. Posts syndicated between different owned and operated properties were misreporting language and geo data. Service connects to all DBs and determines post origin to accurately render
                    the canonical tag and tags for all other versions including country and language codes. Reduced HREFLang errors reported by Google from millions to double digits, boosted views across all properties.

                    Replaced legacy search functionality with Google Search Appliance. Improved search accuracy and speed, introduced search-as-you-type for realtime lookahead completion of search terms.
                    Kept GSA index current by adding/removing deals as they were added to inventory or sold out. Leveraged variants to pre-select appropriate attributes on product page based on search terms (shirt color/size, etc) to improve UX. Added left hand facet-based
                    navigation and filtering for post-search refinement.

                    required to accurately calculate tax rates. Developed caching system to maintain potential tax rates on the browser during shopping based on user's shipping address and all vendors' shipping warehouses to streamline checkout.

                    Worked with two other engineers on 6 month PCI Compliance Audit. Split monolithic repository into three (user facing store, checkout, API). Physically segmented baremetal network so credit card handling was isolated and had no contact with the DB.
                    Forced SOA/microservice design patterns while direct DB access was stripped from most of the new system in favor of REST calls.
